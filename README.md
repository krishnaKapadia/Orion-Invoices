# Orion-Invoices
Online Invoicing and Client Management tool

Orion Invoices is a service that allows small business to manage their clients, invoices, employees and orders from an online dashboard. Originally created this specifically for Amba Screen Printers and Embroidery, as they were wanting a solution that allowed them to manage their business without going in. 

So we came up with a solution that would allow for them to:
- Create and manage invoices
- Manage orders
- Keep track of their clients and Employees.

Over the course of 3 months I worked side by side iterating through each feature, getting feedback at the end of each day therefore using agile methods to ensure that the solution that I created was what the client wanted. 

Overall they were very happy with the end result and I realised that this could help many other small to medium sized businesses so I turned it into a SaaS to accomodate this.
